## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model using CNN to recognize various types of clothing from images. The model is trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and is capable of classifying items into one of the following ten classes:

- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

## Dataset

- Format: 28x28 grayscale images
- Training images: 60,000
- Test images: 10,000
- Balanced across 10 categories
