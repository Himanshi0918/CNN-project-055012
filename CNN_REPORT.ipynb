        "### 1. Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The task of image classification is central to many real-world applications including retail inventory management, fashion recommendation systems, and e-commerce product categorization. Traditional algorithms struggle with high-dimensional raw pixel data. The emergence of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offers a robust solution by automatically extracting hierarchical feature representations from images.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to leverage a CNN model to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset into ten fashion-related categories. The goal is to develop a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data, maintains high accuracy, and avoids overfitting.\n",
